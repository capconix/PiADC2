# PiADC2
PiADC open source project successor, the PiADC2 - A simple data acquisition board for use with the model B Raspberry Pis. This is the low speed version capable of 10 - 100 samples per second on all channels.

When this project is completed I'll be moving onto a PiADC2-HS that should hopefully be closer to 10K samples per second across 8 or 16 channels.

This is currrently an untested project
